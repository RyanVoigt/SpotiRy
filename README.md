# Cloning Repository
## The "app_secret" and "client_id" have been removed in this Github version to avoid releasing account secret to the public, if you want to run this code on your personal computer:

1) Go to https://developer.spotify.com/ and sign up for a developer account
2) You will be given a app_secret and client_id, copy and paste these into the app.js file this allows you to make api requests to spotify


## Running code
In order to run the different examples, open the folder with the name of the flow you want to try out, and run its `app.js` file. For instance, to run the Authorization Code example do:

$ cd Website
$ node app.js

Then, open `http://localhost:8888` in a browser.

## Contributing
